NOTE TO SELF a notes about Temporary Variables for Control Flow



FUNCTIONS
len() - amount of elements within a list also length
mylist.append() - adding a single element to my list and placed at the end
int() - integer or number without decimals
float() - a number with decimals
from myfile import myfunction - importing a function definition 
print() - speak the texts 
input() - used to prompt inside terminal, opposite of print 
range - start, end, step
in - checks to see if a keys in the dictionary or a value is in a array 
not - opposite of in (see in) 

end="" - don't print a new line

for char in range(len(word) -1, -1, -1): - 


print("\n") - next line, creates an empty line 


EXAMPLE FOR LISTS
[] - an empty list - A value

[1,2,3] - A value and a list containing the elements 1,2,3

[1,[2,3,4],5] - The element at the index 0 is the integer 1, the element at index 1 is a list containing 2,3,4 and the element at index 2 is the integer 5


mylist = [1,[2,3,4],5] 
mylist[1][0] - grab the value at index 1 equal to the list of [2,3,4] then we grab the value at index0 which is equal to 2


EXAMPLE FOR CONTROL FLOW
myindex = 0
while myindex < 10:
	#do something
	myindex = myindex + 1

 
mylist[myindex] - grabs a single value from mylist at the position specified at my index - A variable% - modulus. takes the remainder of division 
== - check for equality  
= - assigning an value to a variable


EXAMPLE FOR DERIVATIVE

y = 2x^2 = 2x + 2

dy/dx = 4x + 2

'delta y over delta x' = 'change in y over change in x' 

term: coefficient * independent variable ^ exponent

coefficient * exponent  * independent variable ^ (exponent-1) 

derivative of a constant is 0



CONTROL FLOW SEQUENCE COMMANDS
def myfunction() - defining/creating a function from a statement-block of code
while - repeatedly execute a block of code until specified condition is false
if - execute a block of code if the specified condition is true
else - execute a block of code if the previous specified condition is false

elif - execute a block of code if the previous speicifed condition is false and current specified conditon is true... Continuing to check different conditions. 

break - stop the repetition despite conditions of current loop
return - gives back the result of the function and stops a function 
for - short hand for while; basically it assigns (more later)


Terminology
single value - float, an integer, or a list
variable - single name in program that stores a single value
element - a location in a list that stores a single value 
built in functions - built within python language 
control-flow-sequences - commands that determine what sequence a part of the program get completed and when 
derivative - gives the slope of the curve 

Console Commands
pip3 - package manager, to install pakcages to import more functions
grep - searching text or regular expressions/patterns of text, for occurences in a file
