#Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit. Go to the editor
#[ Formula : c/5 = (f-32)/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
#Expected Output :
#60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
#45°F is 7 in Celsius 



#32 + 9*c/5 = f 


c = 60
f = 32 + 9 * c/5
print(f)

#fah = c / 5
#cel = f - 32/9 

#print(fah)





#where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit
